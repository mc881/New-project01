        <p>Hi! I am Mahesh Chaudhary. This is Bellevue University from where I completed my bachelor's degree. It is located in Bellevue, Nebraska. I am on Summer holidays.
            <br> I generally like to visit new places in Summer.
            <br>But, this year I am not willing to visit any places because this very critical time for travelling any where because of Coronavirus.
            <br>For safety, I just stay at home and spend time with my family. I like to watch movies in free time.
